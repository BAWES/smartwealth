    <div class="modal-description">Bonds are investments in debt issued by governments, agencies, or corporations
      globally. Typically, we categorize our bond investments into two categories: U.S. Bonds and Non-U.S. bonds. While
      they share similar characteristics to U.S. bonds, international bonds offer exposure to different geographies and
      currencies. While they generally offer lower returns than stocks, bonds are less volatile. Bonds also tend to move
      inversely to stocks, providing stabilization during periods of volatility.</div>
